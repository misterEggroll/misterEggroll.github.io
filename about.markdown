## Professional

I'm a software professional based out of Bangalore, India.

I'm currently employed at [Skit][1], we build voicebots for call centers. 
Prior to working at Skit, I was working at [EMC2][2] for 5 years at their Enterprise Content Divison.

I've worked primarily as a backend engineer using Golang, Python and Java as the programming languages I tried to wield my magic using.  

## Personal

I'm originally from Jamshedpur, India. I spent my formative years there before doing my Engineering degree from Manipal 
Institute of Technology in Karnataka. I'm now based out of Bangalore. When I'm not working, I'm probably playing FIFA on my PS4, riding my cycle or 
playing with my 2 cats. 

I've had a love affair with words thanks to all the women in my life.

For as long as I can remember, my grandmother spent all her time reading books. Having been denied higher education herself, she ensured her 4 kids had 10 degrees to boast of between them.

My mother taught literature at school. When she was not busy trying to tame my sister and myself into being more civil, 
she was usually engrossed in either poetry or prose from a bygone era, trying to deconstruct it for the benefit of her students. 

My sister was elocutionist extraordinaire. Debating champ and all-round overachiever.

Besides this trio, you may find in these words, traces of my father, who tended to be more of a funny-man with a dry 
sense of humor. My friends quote his jokes to me to this day.

This website is an attempt to step away from habits that are more consumption based to one that is more creation based. 
I've long considered subjecting the world to my thoughts, I hope you find them entertaining.
